						<h2>Welcome to our website about federated machine learning!</h2>
						<p>Our team has been working with the KDD99 Cup dataset to develop shared machine learning models using this cutting-edge technology.</p>
						<p>The KDD99 Cup dataset is a well-known dataset used in intrusion detection research, which contains a mix of normal and attack network traffic data. Our team has been using this dataset to develop models that can identify patterns and anomalies in network traffic that may indicate potential security breaches.</p>
						<p>Our focus has been on developing models that can improve the accuracy of intrusion detection while preserving the privacy of the data. Through our research, we aim to contribute to the field of federated machine learning and improve the security of networks and systems.</p>
						<p>We invite you to explore our website to learn more about our work with the KDD99 Cup dataset and federated machine learning. Thank you for visiting, and we hope you find our website informative and helpful.</p>
