			<p>Federated machine learning is a type of machine learning that allows multiple parties to collaborate and build a shared machine learning model without sharing their private data with each other.</p>
			<p>In a traditional machine learning approach, a single entity or organization would collect and analyze all the data to train the machine learning model. However, in federated learning, the data remains decentralized and is distributed across multiple devices or organizations, and the model training occurs on these devices without the need to centralize the data.</p>
			<p>Federated learning works by breaking down the machine learning model training process into two phases: the local training phase and the aggregation phase. In the local training phase, each device or organization trains the machine learning model using their local data. In the aggregation phase, the locally trained models are sent to a central server where they are combined to create a new, more robust machine learning model. This process allows each device or organization to contribute to the overall model without exposing their private data to others.</p>
			<p>Federated learning has several advantages over traditional machine learning approaches, including increased privacy and security, as well as the ability to work with large and distributed datasets. It has many practical applications, such as in healthcare, finance, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices, where data privacy and security are paramount.</p>
			<p>However, federated learning also presents some challenges and limitations, such as the need for efficient communication between devices and the potential for data biases due to data distribution. Researchers are currently exploring different methods to address these challenges and improve the performance of federated learning models.</p>
